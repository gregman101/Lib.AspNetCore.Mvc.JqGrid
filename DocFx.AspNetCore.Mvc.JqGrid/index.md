# Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid

Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid is a set of libraries which provide support for [Guriddo jqGrid](http://guriddo.net/) and [free jqGrid](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid) usage in ASP.NET Core.

## Getting Started

Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid is available on NuGet. You can drag all packages at once by installing the top level one.

```
PM> Install-Package Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid.Helper
```

But you can also install only the needed packages if you don't require the full functionality.

```
PM> Install-Package Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid.Core
```

```
PM> Install-Package Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid.DataAnnotations
```

## Demos

The demo project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tpeczek/Demo.AspNetCore.JqGrid).

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tpeczek).
